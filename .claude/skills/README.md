- Digest format validation (sha256:hex or sha512:hex)
- Transport types: stdio (default) vs http
- Entrypoint selection algorithm with OS/arch matching
- Permissions structure: network allowlists, environment variables, subprocess control, filesystem
- Resource limits: cpu_millis, memory_mb, max_pids, max_fds, timeout_seconds

**Use when:** Parsing manifests, validating manifest structure, selecting entrypoints, designing manifest examples

**Key validation rules:**
- Required fields: schema_version, package (org/name/version), bundle (digest/size), transport, entrypoints
- Entrypoint keys: must be platform-arch (e.g., linux-amd64, darwin-arm64)
- Transport values: must be "stdio" or "http" (default: stdio)

### 3. content-cache.md (1156 lines, 28 KB)
**Expert knowledge for content-addressable cache implementation**

Key topics:
- Content-addressable design principles (immutability, deduplication, integrity)
- Directory structure: ~/.mcp/cache/{manifests,bundles}/sha256:*/
- Metadata file structure (digest, size, timestamps, package info)
- Store interface definition with core operations
- Atomic write pattern: temp file → validate → rename (prevents corruption)
- Get operation with last-access timestamp updates
- Exists checks (single and batch)
- Delete operation with cleanup
- List operation with sorting and filtering
- Cache size calculation (total and by type)
- Eviction strategies: TTL-based, LRU, size-based
- Thread-safety patterns: RWMutex, per-digest locks
- Filesystem locking (optional, platform-specific)
- CopyToPath operation for bundle extraction
- 5 common issues with solutions:
  1. Race conditions on concurrent writes
  2. Partial writes on disk full
  3. Corrupted metadata files
  4. Unbounded cache growth
  5. Lost last-access metadata
- Testing patterns: atomic writes, concurrent access, eviction policies
- Integration with registry client (caching downloaded artifacts)
- Debugging and inspection commands
- Schema versioning for future upgrades

**Use when:** Implementing cache store, handling concurrent access, eviction policies, bundle extraction

**Key patterns:**
- Per-digest mutex locks prevent concurrent corruption
- Atomic writes: write to temp, validate hash, rename to final location
- Digest always used as key (never trust filename)
- Content verified after download and after cache retrieval
- Async last-access updates don't block reads

## How to Use These Skills

### Performance & Profiling Workflow

When optimizing mcp-client:

1. **Profile first** → Use **golang-performance.md** for pprof setup
2. **Identify bottlenecks** → Analyze with go tool pprof and flamegraphs
3. **Benchmark changes** → Write benchmarks with proper ResetTimer patterns
4. **Compare results** → Use benchstat to quantify improvements
5. **Track in CI** → Add benchmark regression tests (see ci-cd-mcp-client.md)

### Production Troubleshooting Workflow

When debugging failures:

1. **Check exit code** → Reference exit code table in debugging-production.md
2. **Enable logging** → Use --log-level debug and JSON format
3. **Analyze logs** → Parse with jq commands from debugging-production.md
4. **Trace calls** → Use strace/dtrace commands from debugging-production.md
5. **Verify cache** → Use mcp cache ls and integrity checks
6. **Check system** → Run mcp doctor to verify capabilities

### CI/CD Implementation Workflow

When setting up automation:

1. **Design matrix** → Use testing strategy from ci-cd-mcp-client.md
2. **Configure linting** → Reference golangci-lint settings
3. **Setup coverage** → Integrate codecov as shown
4. **Create release** → Use goreleaser patterns for multi-platform builds
5. **Handle artifacts** → Generate checksums and optional SBOM
6. **Monitor performance** → Add benchmark regression detection

## How to Use These Skills

### In Claude Code / Agent Workflows

Reference the skills explicitly when working on related components:

```
@claude-code analyze registry-api to implement HTTP client with proper retry logic
@claude-code use mcp-manifest for manifest parser validation logic
@claude-code reference content-cache for thread-safe store implementation
```

### For Implementation Tasks

When implementing registry integration:
1. Start with **registry-api.md** for HTTP client structure and endpoints
2. Use **mcp-manifest.md** for manifest parsing logic
3. Apply **content-cache.md** patterns for caching downloaded artifacts

### For Code Review

When reviewing:
- Registry client code → check against registry-api.md patterns
- Manifest parser → validate against mcp-manifest.md schema
- Cache implementation → verify concurrency patterns in content-cache.md

### Implementation Skill Connections

### registry-api → mcp-manifest
