# Sandbox Security Limitations

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

The mcp-client sandbox has **KNOWN LIMITATIONS** on macOS and Windows that allow malicious MCPs to bypass resource limits.

---

## macOS Limitations

### Resource Limits: RESOLVED via sandbox-exec

**Severity:** MITIGATED
**Status:** FIXED - sandbox-exec (Seatbelt SBPL) integration implemented

**What was fixed:**
- The broken `syscall.Setrlimit()` approach (which only affected the parent) has been replaced
- macOS now uses `sandbox-exec` with dynamically generated SBPL profiles
- Filesystem isolation: deny-by-default with explicit allowlists per manifest
- Network isolation: deny-all when no manifest network permissions; allow-all when permissions present
- Subprocess control: can deny process-exec via SBPL rules
- Timeout enforcement: via `context.WithTimeout` in the executor (SIGKILL)

**What WORKS on macOS:**
- Filesystem isolation via sandbox-exec (kernel-enforced, deny-by-default)
- Network isolation via sandbox-exec (deny-all or allow-all based on manifest)
- Subprocess restriction via SBPL profile rules
- Timeout enforcement via context cancellation (SIGKILL)

**What DOES NOT work on macOS:**
- CPU resource limits on child processes (no cgroups equivalent)
- Memory resource limits on child processes (no cgroups equivalent)
- PID count limits (no cgroups equivalent)
- File descriptor limits (macOS SysProcAttr has no Rlimits field)
- Per-host network filtering (sandbox-exec only supports allow-all or deny-all)

**Remaining risk:**
- Resource exhaustion (CPU/memory/PIDs) is not preventable without external tooling
- For production, use Docker containers or Linux VMs for resource limit enforcement

**Recommended Actions:**
- ✅ Development/testing: macOS provides good filesystem/network isolation
- ✅ Production: Use Linux with cgroups for resource limits; macOS sandbox-exec for filesystem/network
- ⚠️ Resource limits: External monitoring or Docker required for CPU/memory enforcement

## Windows Limitations

### Job Objects: RESOLVED

**Severity:** RESOLVED
**Status:** FIXED - Job Objects are now fully functional

**What was fixed:**
- `setJobLimits()` now calls `SetInformationJobObject()` via kernel32.dll syscall
- Memory limits (ProcessMemoryLimit + JobMemoryLimit) are enforced
- Process count limits (ActiveProcessLimit) are enforced
- CPU rate control via `JOBOBJECT_CPU_RATE_CONTROL_INFORMATION` implemented
- `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` ensures orphan processes are terminated

**Defense-in-depth measures integrated:**
- **Restricted tokens**: `CreateRestrictedToken()` with `DISABLE_MAX_PRIVILEGE` strips privileges from child processes (best-effort)
- **Low integrity levels**: Fallback if restricted tokens fail; prevents writing to medium-integrity objects
- **AppContainer profiles**: Created for audit trail (best-effort, non-blocking)
- **Mitigation policies**: Subprocess control via Job Object ActiveProcessLimit

**What WORKS on Windows:**
- Memory limits via Job Objects (enforced)
- Process count limits via Job Objects (enforced)
- CPU rate control via Job Objects (enforced, Windows 8+)
- Privilege reduction via restricted tokens (best-effort)
- Integrity level reduction (best-effort fallback)
- Process grouping with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE (enforced)
- Timeout enforcement (parent process monitoring)

**What DOES NOT work on Windows:**
- Network isolation (requires kernel drivers or WFP)
- Filesystem isolation (limited to Windows ACLs; AppContainer not applied at spawn time)

### Remaining Windows Mechanisms (Partial Integration)

**1. AppContainers (Win 10+)** — CREATED BUT NOT APPLIED AT SPAWN
- Profiles are created for audit purposes
- Full spawn-time integration requires `CreateProcessW` with `SECURITY_CAPABILITIES`, which Go's `exec.Cmd` does not support
- Profiles are cleaned up on process termination

**2. Restricted Tokens** — INTEGRATED (best-effort)
- `CreateRestrictedToken()` with `DISABLE_MAX_PRIVILEGE` applied to child processes
- Strips all enabled privileges from the token
- Falls back to low integrity if restricted token creation fails

**3. Integrity Levels (Low)** — INTEGRATED (fallback)
- Applied when restricted token creation fails
- Prevents child process from writing to medium-integrity objects

**4. Process Mitigation Policies** — PARTIAL
- Subprocess control enforced via Job Object ActiveProcessLimit
- Full `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_MITIGATION_POLICY` requires `STARTUPINFOEX` (not supported by Go's exec.Cmd)

## Recommendations by Environment

### For Development:
- ✅ **Linux**: Full sandbox, all features work
- ⚠️ **macOS**: Acceptable with awareness of limitations
- ⚠️ **Windows**: Acceptable with awareness of limitations
- **Rule:** Never test malicious/untrusted code on macOS/Windows

### For Production:
- ✅ **Linux bare metal**: Full sandbox with cgroups v2
- ✅ **Docker on any platform**: Container resource limits
- ✅ **Kubernetes**: Pod resource quotas + Network Policies
- ❌ **macOS bare metal**: NOT RECOMMENDED
- ❌ **Windows bare metal**: NOT RECOMMENDED (wait for fix)

### For CI/CD:
- ✅ **Linux runners**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI (ubuntu-latest)
- ⚠️ **macOS runners**: Only for compilation/unit tests, NOT for running untrusted MCPs
- ⚠️ **Windows runners**: Only for compilation/unit tests, NOT for running untrusted MCPs

### For Enterprise:
- ✅ **Kubernetes**: Best isolation + observability
- ✅ **Docker Swarm**: Good isolation + orchestration
- ✅ **Linux VMs**: KVM/Xen with cgroups
- ⚠️ **Windows VMs**: Wait for Job Object fix
- ❌ **Bare metal macOS/Windows**: PROHIBITED

- **Remaining gap:** CPU/memory/PID resource limits cannot be enforced (no macOS mechanism available)
- **Mitigation:** Use Docker containers or Linux VMs for resource limit enforcement

### Windows Job Objects - RESOLVED

## Verification Commands

### Check if limits are applied (Linux):
```bash
# Run MCP and check cgroups
mcp run acme/tool &
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/mcp-*/memory.max
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/mcp-*/cpu.max
```

### Check if limits are applied (macOS):
```bash
# This will FAIL (limits not propagated)
mcp run acme/tool &
ps aux | grep mcp-server
# Memory/CPU limits will be system defaults, NOT configured limits
```

### Check if limits are applied (Windows):
```powershell
# This will FAIL (Job Object limits not set)
mcp run acme/tool &
Get-Process -Name "mcp-server" | Select-Object -Property WorkingSet, CPU
# No Job Object limits will be enforced
```
